    <h3>Investment Criteria</h3>
    <p>We support partners and enterprises whose work strengthens health, resilience, and inclusive economic participation. Our approach prioritizes initiatives that demonstrate both long-term sustainability and the potential for community-rooted value creation. We look for models that can generate compounding impact while also contributing to shared prosperity, especially those with pathways to broadened ownership, recurring value, and enduring local relevance. A defensible position, clear purpose, and regenerative potential are essential hallmarks of the work we support.</p>

    <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
    <p>We focus on sectors and strategies that shape the environments where people live, learn, heal, and grow. This includes health and wellness, inclusive infrastructure, technology transfer, housing, and place-based solutions that address the social and economic drivers of well-being. Our efforts are grounded in a commitment to building just economies by expanding access to capital for individuals and institutions with high capability but limited historical access. We are especially focused on regions that have long powered broader prosperity, particularly in the American and Global South, recognizing their critical role in shaping a resilient and equitable future.</p>

    <h3>Defining Success</h3>
    <p>SRF Capital measures success by the momentum we create in strengthening the people and platforms already building enduring health and wealth in their communities. We look for sustained progress across multiple dimensions of (W)Health, both within our investments and across the broader systems they influence. We view innovation not as novelty for its own sake, but as the natural outcome of proximity, trust, and deep engagement with communities that have long had to build brilliance from constraint.</p>
