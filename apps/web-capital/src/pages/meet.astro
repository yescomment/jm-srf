    <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
    <p>We envision a global economy where value and utility are defined by the good of all humanity. A global economy where investments are made by moral leaders who are dedicated to helping individuals find dignity, self-determine their joy, and thrive in place.</p>

    <h2>Deep Expertise and Proximate Leadership</h2>
    <p>The SRF Capital team has backgrounds in public and private-sector finance, policy, real estate, entrepreneurship, and technology. We have proximate relationships that span decades, and each team member has lived experience as a member of or a close partner to the communities we serve. These relationships and experiences differentiate us from other firms and give us a unique perspective on how to create value and Impact alongside the institutions and communities in which we invest.</p>

    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>We are driven by our commitment to seeing that all people experience and live out their highest callings and deepest joys. When frontier and emerging communities are <strong>physically, emotionally, educationally, and economically thriving</strong>, the roadmap for a joyful and resilient future unfolds for us all. We act in alignment with our following three values:</p>

    <h3>Leadership at the Intersection of Impact and Alpha</h3>
    <p>We know it takes both to create transformational change that is anchored by sustainable returns.</p>

    <h3>Success with Honor</h3>
    <p>We work at the highest levels of integrity.</p>

    <h3>G.A.S.</h3>
    <p>We unapologetically and with whole hearts, <strong>G</strong>ive <strong>A</strong> <strong>S</strong>hit about people, places and the planet. Our investment focus and practices are a direct reflection of these priorities.</p>

    <h2>Diversity is a Competitive Advantage</h2>
    <p>We seek out opportunities to find people to enhance diversity across our investments—not only in terms of race, ethnicity or gender, but also in terms of thought leadership and proximity to the communities in which we invest. Increased creativity and an openness to expanding the experiences and approaches  that lead to increased Impact and Alpha, are what we know to be a competitive advantage.</p>

    <p>Philanthropic institutions and traditional investment efforts often engage in siloed causes that bifurcate economic and social returns <strong>rather than integrating them in ways that can lead to Impact and Alpha</strong>. Our investment framework acts in a coordinated manner to create a new systems-level “normal” that unifies the “invisible hand” of the economic market with the “moral heart” of the love of humanity.</p>

    <p>We believe that by investing in opportunities that couple and stack the United Nations’ <a href="">Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</a>, we can tackle adaptive challenges, move away from extractive markets, and build the equitable economies of the future.</p>
