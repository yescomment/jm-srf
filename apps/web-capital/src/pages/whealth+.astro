    <h2>(W)Health+ Universal Impact Measurement</h2>
    <p>Capital and organizational value creation is whole and non-divisible. SRF Capital, with our partners, takes an ecosystem-level capital strategy that strengthens and accelerates entrepreneurs, managers, and institutions dedicated to building health and wealth in communities. We know that growth is only meaningful when it is scaled by investment with a clear impact and public value. Our investment thesis gives us the best opportunity to scale investments and lead with Impact.</p>
    <p>SRF Capital’s investments move beyond surface-level investments and categories to provide funding that meaningfully impacts quality of life while producing Impact alpha returns.</p>
