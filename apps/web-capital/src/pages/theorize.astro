    <h3>Investment Criteria</h3>
    <p>SRF Capital invests in funds and institutions that have Impact alpha investment theses that are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focused on driving multiple  improvements in Health & Wellness;</li>
      <li>Demonstrate an ability to create recurring revenue streams; and</li>
      <li>Where possible, are positioned for distributive ownership models.</li>
      <li>Investments must have defensible advantage(s) with an attractive sustainable growth profile and strategic competitive differentiation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus Industries and Geographies</h3>
    <p>SRF Capital seeks opportunities that affect the social determinants of (W)Health, including health and healthcare infrastructure, health and healthcare technology transfer and commercialization, on- and near-campus investments, healthy housing and green infrastructure. We build these investments across private markets that support the creation of just economies by investing into highly capable, but thinly capitalized individuals and institutions so that all communities might have an opportunity to thrive in place.  Special attention is focused in the American and Global South, including the American Southeast and Rustbelt regions, recognizing that these are the regions that built the United States.</p>

    <h3>Defining Success</h3>
    <p>SRF Capital employs an ecosystem-level capital strategy that strengthens and promotes the entrepreneurs, leaders and institutions that have long been dedicated to building health and wealth in their communities.</p>
