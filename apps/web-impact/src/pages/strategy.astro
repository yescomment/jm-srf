		<p>A (W)Health-based investment strategy creates value across multiple asset areas that build on each other for multiple generations. We consider the well-being and mobility of all people in a community to provide true opportunities for people to develop comprehensive strategies and build health and wellness. An asset class that includes social, physical, financial, and political capital at the foundation is needed for a prosperous community and the equitable economies of the future.</p>

		<h2>SRF Impact Institute</h2>
		<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
		<p>The Institute is a bold new platform under development by SRF Impact. It exists to answer a vital question of our time: What does it mean to be a responsible steward of capital in a world that demands justice, regeneration, and resilience?</p>
		<p>At its core, the Institute responds to a growing demand for capital that does more than generate financial returns. It seeks to restore dignity, accelerate opportunity, and strengthen the systems that allow all communities to thrive. In a financial landscape still shaped by outdated models, the Institute aims to shift both mindset and mechanism, reimagining capital as a tool for collective prosperity, especially in communities that are rich in talent, innovation, and cultural wisdom but have been historically excluded from access to capital. Through a combination of transdisciplinary research, leadership development, mission-aligned strategy, and networked learning, the Institute provides the intellectual and moral infrastructure needed to catalyze the inclusive economies of the future.</p>
		<p>The Institute’s work is especially focused on emerging and frontier communities in the Global South, where proximity and generational knowledge provide powerful blueprints for equitable growth. Its philosophy is grounded in a simple truth: every community has the right and the capacity to thrive in place. As a field catalyst, the Institute offers a trusted home for capital actors who are ready to move from intent to impact, from isolation to shared learning, and from inherited systems to intentionally designed futures. Whether through leadership fellowships, policy engagement, or values-aligned partnerships, the Institute creates space for capital to be directed toward its highest and most inclusive purpose.</p>
		<p>Currently forming strategic partnerships across the impact investing, academic, and philanthropic sectors, the Institute will launch its first programs, convenings, and research collaborations early next year, shaping a generation of capital stewards who lead with community trust and financial fluency in equal measure.</p>

		<h2>Core Pillars of the Institute</h2>
		<ol>
			<h3><li>Transdisciplinary Research & Knowledge Production</li></h3>
			<p>In an interconnected world, the most urgent challenges demand integrated thinking. The Institute produces research that bridges finance, health, climate, policy, and equity, surfacing actionable insights that align capital with the full spectrum of human potential. This research is grounded in lived experience and local genius and serves as a foundation for bolder, more relevant models of capital design and impact strategy.</p>

			<h3><li>Leadership Development & Capital Stewardship</li></h3>
			<p>Capital reflects the character of those who shape it. As a historic transfer of wealth unfolds, the need for value-driven capital stewards has never been greater. The Institute nurtures emerging leaders from family offices, foundations, and capital allocators, individuals who bring cultural fluency, integrity, and proximity to the communities they serve. Through its programs, the Institute elevates a new generation of fiduciaries who understand both financial systems and human systems.</p>

			<h3><li>Capital Strategy & Highest Use Advisory</li></h3>
			<p>The Institute does not manage capital, but it does help others use it more wisely. It serves as a design lab for catalytic strategy, supporting business leaders, family offices, and mission-aligned institutions in deploying capital with greater intention and purpose. By centering community insight and shared value, the Institute supports capital holders in aligning their resources with regenerative, long-term outcomes.</p>

			<h3><li>Networked Learning Communities & Convenings</li></h3>
			<p>No one reimagines capital alone. The Institute activates global communities of practice that turn shared learning into coordinated action. Across borders and sectors, it brings together capital stewards, civic innovators, entrepreneurs, and researchers to develop new models of investment, accountability, and inclusive growth. These gatherings go beyond dialogue. From regional strategy labs to a flagship annual forum for influential family capital stewards and institutional partners, the Institute’s convenings are designed to surface solutions, formalize partnerships, and mobilize resources toward a more just and regenerative economic future. By grounding action in deep relationships and proximity to community insight, the Institute helps build a field where capital is moved not just with intention, but with alignment, urgency, and shared direction.</p>

			<h3><li>Measurement, Accountability & Field Standards</li></h3>
			<p>The Institute is developing a new generation of impact measurement that defines, collects, and applies data reflecting the real conditions of life and the full spectrum of return. This includes both quantitative and qualitative indicators that go beyond compliance to drive decision-making, reveal what’s working, and identify where improvement is needed. The focus is not just on measuring impact but on innovating systems that make data meaningful and actionable. These tools help capital stewards evaluate progress across three critical dimensions: the quality, duration, and resilience of life. From health and opportunity to cohesion and mobility, the Institute supports partners in using data to enhance outcomes, strengthen strategy, and deepen the effectiveness of capital. By redefining what we value and how we measure it, the Institute helps build a more accountable, adaptive, and purpose-aligned capital ecosystem that treats measurement as a tool for learning and transformation rather than reporting alone.</p>
