		<h2>How Impact Works</h2>
    <p>SRF Impact is privileged to steward, advise, and invest gifts entrusted to us by families and individuals committed to bolstering wealth creation, social mobility, and better health for all. We help families navigate the how, what, and why of Impact Investing. Our family advisory committee only selects a limited number of missioned aligned families that are interested in investing and having an impact through FundONE and the Southern Reconstruction Fund.</p>
