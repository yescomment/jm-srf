		<h2>The infrastructure of the next economies is being built now</h2>
		<p>Accelerators are developing impact enterprises. Intermediaries are creating new markets. Policy advocates are shaping enabling environments. Universities are training the next generation of practitioners. Measurement bodies are building the standards that will define the field.</p>
		<p>These organizations create the conditions in which capital can flow toward human futures at scale. They are the connective tissue of social finance. We find them and resource them to reach the next level.</p>
		<blockquote>Our role is to strengthen what exists, connect what is fragmented, and provide patient capital where it creates multiplier effects across the ecosystem.</blockquote>

		<h2>We seek out visionary organizations and ask what they need</h2>
		<p>There are enough great ideas in the world. What the field needs is capital willing to find them, resource them properly, and then step back. We identify organizations with transformative potential and partner with them for the long term.</p>

		<div class="columns">
			<div>
				<h4>Design Capital</h4>
				<p>Patient, flexible funding that provides runway to test ideas, refine models, and scale what works. We walk from the philanthropic side of the capital spectrum, leading with grants and technical assistance, progressing to recoverable grants and program-related investments, employing guarantees and first-loss positions to unlock co-investment.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Select Few, Go Deep</h4>
				<p>We partner with a small number of organizations at a time, providing each with substantial capital and devoted attention. These are long-term relationships built on mission alignment and mutual commitment. We tailor funding to fit each partner's needs rather than forcing them into predetermined structures.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Fund, Amplify, Connect</h4>
				<p>We see ourselves as an amplifier and enabler of others' work. Rather than replicating what already exists, we strengthen existing anchor institutions and equip them with resources to reach the next level. Our portfolio becomes a network of organizations learning from each other.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Trust</h4>
				<p>Organizations are selected because of their expertise and proximity to the work. They understand what their communities need. Our role is to provide strategic guidance, mentorship, and access to networks. We invest in people and then go to work for our investments.</p>

		<h2>Where we deploy capital</h2>
		<p>We strengthen the global infrastructure of social finance by investing in the organizations that shape the field and create multiplier effects. A well-placed investment in field infrastructure ripples out to benefit countless other efforts.</p>

		<div class="columns">
			<div>
				<h4>Accelerators &amp; Venture Builders</h4>
				<p>Organizations incubating and scaling impact enterprises. A single investment in a high-performing accelerator may support dozens of ventures over time.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Market Intermediaries</h4>
				<p>Entities connecting capital to opportunity, structuring deals, and creating financial products that improve capital flows.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Policy &amp; Advocacy</h4>
				<p>Institutions shaping the regulatory environment. A single policy change can open markets or redirect billions.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Universities &amp; Research</h4>
				<p>Academic centers generating evidence, developing talent, and institutionalizing blended value in education.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Convenings &amp; Communications</h4>
				<p>Platforms building community, shaping narrative, and attracting more practitioners and capital to the field.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Measurement &amp; Standards</h4>
				<p>Organizations creating the frameworks and verification systems that build trust across the ecosystem.</p>
