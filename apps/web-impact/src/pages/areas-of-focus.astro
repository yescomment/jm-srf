		<h2>(W)Health Capital</h2>
    <p>To build the equitable economies of the future, we must expand the very definition of capital—what it is, what it can do, and whom it serves. (W)Health Capital is SRF Impact’s approach to reimagining capital as a tool for long-term wellbeing, shared prosperity, and generational strength. It prioritizes proximity, flexibility, and purpose in how capital is sourced, structured, and shared.</p>

    <p>This philosophy begins with a clear understanding: many communities already hold the ideas, ingenuity, and institutional strength needed to build durable infrastructure, grow wealth, and expand opportunity. These places are rich in leadership and ready for investment. The challenge lies not in their capacity, but in how legacy systems have failed to align capital with their potential. Our work is to help reorient investment systems toward what is already strong, already working, and ready to scale.</p>

    <p>(W)Health Capital invests in entrepreneurs, managers, and institutions that are already building the foundations of a more inclusive and resilient economy. These leaders bring deep expertise, cultural insight, and adaptive vision to the markets they serve. Their work is not marginal—it is catalytic. By aligning with their momentum, (W)Health Capital helps shape markets that recognize and reward a broader spectrum of value. Capital becomes a partner in expanding freedom, accelerating innovation, and advancing self-determined prosperity across communities poised for growth.</p>

    <h3>(W)Health as Our Investment Ethic</h3>
    <p>(W)Health is the ability and freedom to fully participate in community and capital markets with the highest level of mental, physical, and financial capacity. It’s about being able to shape the systems that affect your life, without facing unfair barriers. It is both the outcome we seek and the foundation we build toward. At its core, (W)Health is a measure of whether our systems support people, not just profit.</p>

    <h3>Putting Philosophy into Practice</h3>
    <p>SRF Impact was created to bring the (W)Health Capital philosophy to life.</p>
    <p>As the companion to SRF Capital, we turn vision into strategy, building partnerships, sharing knowledge, and supporting solutions that help capital flow with greater purpose and precision</p>
    <p>Our goal is simple: help create systems where capital strengthens what’s working, fills in what’s missing, and supports people in building lives of health, wealth, and freedom.</p>
